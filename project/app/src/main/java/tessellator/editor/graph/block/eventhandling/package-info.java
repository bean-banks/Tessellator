package tessellator.editor.graph.block.eventhandling;

/**
 * Any events that occur at the block level are handled by classes in the package.
 * Block level events => the dragging of of blocks and their connectors.
 * Events that correspond to attribute inputs such as text fields are handled
 * by the the theme they are created by, because of their minimal complexity. 
 * Additionally, this package also holds helper classes that purely suport their
 * block level event handler classes.
