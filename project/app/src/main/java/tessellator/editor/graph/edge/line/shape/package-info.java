/**
 * The 'shape' package groups together the factory classes which are used to create
 * lines that can be used as the line componenents of edges. The package also contains
 * an enum which stores an option for each factory within this package. If a new factory
 * class is added to this package then an option that represents that factory must
 * also be added to the LineShape enum.
