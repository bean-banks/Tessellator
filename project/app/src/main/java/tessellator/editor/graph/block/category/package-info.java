package tessellator.editor.graph.block.category;

/**
 * This package contains the BlockCategory class, its subclasses and
 * the Category enum. Each BlockCategory subclass offers a method for
 * creating blocks of their category and then drawing blocks of their
 * category. The Category enum exists so you can identify objects that
 * depend on their block category, such as Block objects.
